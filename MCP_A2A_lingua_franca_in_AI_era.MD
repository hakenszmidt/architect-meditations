## 1.1. S.P.Q.R.

If asked for an empire ww would quickly come back with Ancient Rome. The success of Roman Empire was a result of a combination of multiple factors allowing it to reach its peak during Pax Romana times (27 BCE to 128 CE). We are all aware of military power of dead-effective legions and remember from history lessons how well-organized was empire's centralized administration. Quick family isit to Rome this year shocked me as an architect (IT still counts) that 2 000 year old bridges might be in better shape than Polish ones from mid 20th century.

## 1.2. Lingua franca

What help Romans expad so quickly and maintain its belongins is a result of a one more thing - the common language.

> **lingua franca**, language used as a means of communication between populations speaking vernaculars that are not mutually intelligible.
> [*Encyclopedia Britannica*](https://www.britannica.com/topic/lingua-franca)<br>
> At any modern, international workplace (like EPAM) we use today English as lingua franca. Other examples are Old Church Slavonic attributed to Saint Cyril, who managed with its help to spread christanity across Slavic people. These days, in northern India people quite often use Hindi, it is also one of two official Indian languages. In Africa we have Swahili, *hakuna matata*.

Expansion through new trade routes and deep harbors was crucial for building true economic power in Mediterranean area. There is no better way to integrate conquuered people by making them capable of doing business together. Two common languages, Latin and Kone Greek (in east) helped tremendously. The empire spoke in too many native languagues to let even rich merchant posses enough number of slave translators...

## 1.3. AI and "Back to the Present"

But why the beforementioned examples of Roman Empire and lingua franca are discussed in an article about MCP&A2A two new, emerging AI protocols?
It is actually quite simple. Please let me explain.

# 2. New Kids On The Block
**Model Contenct Protocol** (MCP) and **Agent-To-Agent** (A2A - do not mistake with SAP's "application to application" integration type) are gaining recently a lot of attention. Many experts argue do we really need anything new. Many of them points at OAS/Swagger and promotes idea that AI interacts directly with APIs with no adiitional abstraction layer. 

## 2.1. Solution looking for a problem
Always start with the problem and not the solution. Is seems obvious that when you create a solution first you are later forced to spend countless hours on convincing people that they need it.
Describing AI as "a solution looking for a problem" (thanks again Vlad Grubman!) resonates with me. Multiple organizations investing a lot of efforts (and money) to find best ways how AI can make their bussineses more profitable and competitive. But there are many challenges, not only data quality ("garbage-in, garbage-out"). On of the most profound are difficult integrations with complex and legacy IT infrastructure. Having trust in AI it will create a proper REST request based on partial, outdated specification seems to be a sort of a wishful thinking. Let's admit - it is hard to build and deploy AI applications, they simply require much custom work on letting models interact with data and users.

## 2.2. Solution for "solution looking for a problem" problem
As an integration architect I find very exciting exposing enterprise systems to AI agents, a completely new category of consumers. Despite having many doubts I see some wisdom in introducing new "AI-friendly" protocols, new *lingua franca* of the modern era. Latin and Koine Greek helped 2000 years ago Roman Empire to expand. Who knows? Perhaps MCP and A2A will similarily help organizations to adopt new technology more widely and with measurable outcomes.

## 2.3. New "AI-friendly" protocol? Cool, but why two?
Google in april not only confirmed support for MCP but also introduced its own (but open) Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol. According to Google's narrative it is "complementary, not competing". For certain it is not trying to overlap with MCP, the opposite is on the other hand not clear (yes agents might expose themselves through MCP).
Visual thinkers (architects?) can easily adopt an idea of tho directions, vertical and horizontal. First is MCP, A2A is the second. No to so different form "north-south" and "east-west" in network architecture.
