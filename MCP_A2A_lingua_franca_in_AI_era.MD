## 1.1. S.P.Q.R.

If asked for an empire ww would quickly come back with Ancient Rome. The uccess  of Roman Empire was a result of a combination of multiple factors allowing it to reach its peak during Pax Romana times (27 BCE to 128 CE). We are all aware of military power of dead-effective legions and remember from history lessons how well-organized was empire's centralzied administration. Quick visit to Rome this year shocked me that 2 000 year old bridges might be in better shape than Polish ones from mid 20th century.
